# Minesweeper-Game
My first game project with Python, It is develeped on macos operating system. There is not working correctly on other operating systems.
Before run the program do stuff under the below.

1- Add the all fonts to your font library on your computer.
2- Download PySimpleGUI library on your computer.

All Done!!! You can run the program and play:))

NOTE: For windows, you have to update icon paths. Later the program will runs correctly.
